# TimeTracking

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1. It's a simple time-tracking app using the MEAN stack.

Please note that I do not provide the user and password to log into the MongoDB running on Atlas (cloud server).
If you would like to run the app locally please run a local MongoDB and provide the uri in the app.js.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). There are no detailed unit tests for this project.
