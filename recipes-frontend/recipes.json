Add the ground beef or turkey, cooking until browned and crumbled. Drain any excess fat if needed. Stir in the diced zucchini, cooked rice, diced tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender.\n\nSpoon the meat and vegetable mixture into each bell pepper, packing them tightly. Top each stuffed pepper with shredded cheese. Pour a small amount of water (about 1/4 cup) into the bottom of the baking dish to help steam the peppers. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool slightly. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve warm and enjoy your stuffed peppers with meat and vegetables!"

    "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Thinly slice the potatoes and onion. Cut the broccoli into small florets. Mince the garlic. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the broccoli florets, and blanch for 2-3 minutes until bright green and slightly tender. Drain and set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the heavy cream, milk, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Heat until just starting to simmer, then remove from heat.\n\nIn a greased baking dish, layer half of the sliced potatoes, followed by half of the sliced onions, and then half of the blanched broccoli. Pour half of the cream mixture over the layers and sprinkle with half of the shredded Gruyère or cheddar cheese. Repeat the layers with the remaining potatoes, onions, broccoli, cream mixture, and cheese. Top with grated Parmesan cheese. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender.\n\nLet the gratin cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve warm and enjoy your potato gratin with broccoli! This creamy and cheesy gratin is perfect as a side dish or a vegetarian main course."

    "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the ground meat and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.\n\nIn a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese, ending with a layer of noodles topped with meat sauce and mozzarella cheese.\n\nCover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the noodles are tender. Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve warm and enjoy your delicious lasagna with minced meat! This lasagna is perfect for feeding a crowd."
